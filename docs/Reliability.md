#Reliability

Reliability is one of the most powerful attributes of a high performing team.  When you know that your team members have your back and will be there when you need them, you are freed up to realize your full potential. Reliable team members always follow through on their commitments when they said they would.  Reliable team members make sure that when they follow through on their commitments, they do so with a consistently high level of quality.  In short, you trust them to have your back when you need them to follow through.

When thinking about your confidence in a team member's reliability, think about the times they've told you they would do something for you.

- Did they follow through?
- Did they check in with you to make sure the output was what you needed?
- Were you worried that you may not get what you needed?
