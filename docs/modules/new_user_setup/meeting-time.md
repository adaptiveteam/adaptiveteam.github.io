# Meeting Times

Adaptive appreciates that your time is the most valuable thing you give your company.  With this in mind, we want to make every minute count and we want to do that at a time and place that will be most productive for you.  So when Adaptive sees that a new user has joined, it will reach out to that person and find out when they want to meet.

Choose a time every day when you will have a 15 minutes window to answer questions or learn about something. Consider it your own personal [standup meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting). The platform may not have anything for you at the time you chose.  Having a standing window will keep the your time with Adaptive targeted, hard hitting, and brief.

If you ever want to change your meeting time you can just type to Adaptive "I want to change my meeting time."
