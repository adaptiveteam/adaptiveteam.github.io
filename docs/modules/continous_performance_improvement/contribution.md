# Contribution

A key aspect of highly effective teams is that everyone contributes to the betterment of the team. That includes improvements to the culture, processes, direction, etc.  In other words, it is one thing to deliver value within the established ways of the team.  It is something completely different to contribute to improving those ways.

You should always be thinking about incremental value you can create and recognize the incremental value your colleagues bring.  We often take those improvements for granted but it is those improvements that keep companies adaptive.  When thinking about your confidence in your colleagues ability to contribute to the group, consider -

- Did they publicly strengthen the culture in some way (or weaken it)?
- Are your processes better because they added some improvement?
- Is the team going in a better direction because they pointed out a more productive path forward?
