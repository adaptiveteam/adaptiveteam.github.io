# Energy

Study after study has shown that highly effective teams are also very positive teams.  We have independently found a correlation between positive reinforcement and greater improvements in performance over time. In his seminal book on the topic, [Robert Sutton](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000OT8GV2&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_.VlwCbG8607FV) a professor at Stanford, writes that given two individuals -

- One with superior credentials but is a total jerk
- One with good credentials but everyone loves

Go for the person that everyone loves. The total jerk, it turns out, reduces access to their skills by way of an abrasive personality. This can be a particularly sensitive topic but it is also one of the most critical to adaptive teams.  So when thinking about your confidence in the positive energy your colleague will create in the coming quarter, consider -

- Do you look forward to meeting with them?
- Are you drained after you do meet with them?
- Do you feel like they really listen or are just waiting to respond?
