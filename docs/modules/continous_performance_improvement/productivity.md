# Productivity

Productivity, or how much output your colleagues produce, is a key measurement for highly effective teams. More output in less time is always the goal.  People often forget about the time variable in this equation.  Productivity is relative to the amount of time they spent on producing that output.

Someone who works nights and weekends to drive to a result is less productive than someone who works regular business hours to drive to the same result. Think about your colleague's ability to drive to a result _and_ that amount of time they took to get to that result. It also means producing the _desired_ result instead of a half-baked result delivered breathlessly at the 11th hour.  So when contemplating your confidence in your colleagues productivity, think about - 

- The amount of product they produced
- The quality of the product they produced
- The amount of time they spent producing that outcome
