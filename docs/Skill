# Skill

Great teams work well when they deeply understand each other's strengths and weakensses and seek ways to combine them to create superior team strength.  When you are thinking about your confidence in your colleagues skills, you need to first think about what those skills are.  This is can be different depending on the context and it can change over time.  Furthermore, it can often be different that the person's role.

For example, perhaps your colleague is a developer but was playing the role of project manager - so provide them with feedback on their project management skills.  Perhaps they were a project manager but volunteered to write up documentation - so provided them with feedback on their documentation skills.

So when considering your confidence in your colleagues skills, consider -

- What skills were you relying on over the previous quarter?
- Did they make committments to you based on those skills?
- Are there things they can do to sharpen their skills to deliver better results next quarter?
