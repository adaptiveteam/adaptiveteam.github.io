# Commands

Adaptive can understand basic commands plus natural language requests. The Adaptive Platform is modular by design and not all customers have enabled all modules.  As you enable more modules Adaptive gets smarter, enabling it to do more things and respond to a greater variety of commands and requests.  The table below provides you with the list of commands, request examples, and the Adaptive Modules that can understand them.

At any time you can always say `help` and Adaptive will send you here.

| Command       | Request Examples | Module |
