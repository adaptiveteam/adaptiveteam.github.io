# Introduction
Welcome to Adaptive! You are about to engage in an exciting organizational experience that will help your employees level-up their skills and your company better execute on business strategy.  This quick-start guide will help you get up and going quickly in about 30 minutes. 

_If you would like a brief overview of Adaptive you can watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVu33Af_8wo&list=PLRumqby7xu0Pq_XjEBR558C4KxZuvXvOb&index=1) (0:30)_.

Let's get going!

**Note** - From this point forward, this guide assumes you have worked with your admin team to install Adaptive into your collaboration platform ([Slack installation](https://adaptiveteam.github.io/docs/setup/adaptive-installation)).  

## Adaptive Communities
We designed Adaptive to be easy enough for anyone to administer with the same skills needed when working in your collaboration platform. The permission model is built around Adaptive communities which is just a channel to which you have invited Adaptive. When Adaptive shows up it will ask you what kind of community to create and will present you with a dropdown box. Simply make a choice and then invite your Each community grants different permissions to the people you invite.

First things first, you will want to create an Adaptive administration channel. This channel is largely for informational purposes and will tell you about how the Adaptive is being configured. It will also receive requests from users wishing to work with Adaptive but who have not been invited to a community. To create the Adaptive admin community, do this this:
 1. Create a **private** channel named whatever you wish and complies with company naming conventions if applicable 
 1. Invite Adaptive (`/invite @adaptive`).
 1. Finally, invite whomever you wish to this channel (`/invite @[user name]`).

Now, we need to create the remaining communities (_remember, private channels only_):

Channel Name|Channel Purpose
---|---
admin|for people who need to view ongoing configuration activity
hr|for people from human resources that need to see potentially sensitive information collected and analyzed by Adaptive
values| for collaborating on company values
 coaching|where the coaching team will come together to collaborate with one another to find ways to level-up individuals from across the company
 strategy|where leader can create strategic objectives and stay informed on the strategy
 users|for anyone who wants to provide feedback to their colleagues who are not in one of the other channels.

## Adaptive Dynamic Menu (ADM)
Once you have created your channels and invited Adaptive, you will now be able to interact with Adaptive.  Simply navigate to the app in your collaboration platform.  As soon as you navigate to Adaptive, the bot will present you with a menu.
 
Adaptive created this menu especially for you by running through dozens of health checks and determining what _you can do_ to improve the strategic health of the company. When you are first setting up Adaptive, there are a lot of health checks that won't pass and so Adaptive will begin nudging you to make corrections. Just follow the nudges and Adaptive will help you.
